<h1>FSRI Research 2020--Mathematical Modeling of Induced Protein Expression in E. Coli Cells</h1>

<p>During the 5-week Freshman Summer Research Institute program, I used parameter identification to characterize a model that explains data I wsa given about the following system. I accomplished this under the mentorship of a member of the Murray Lab at Caltech.</p>

<p><b>Figure 1.</b> Chemical inducer Rpa AHL binds to RNA Polymerase. This complex then binds to the promoter for the Rpa_R (R) gene. This binding then initiates transcription, which was considered to occur at a fast rate. Then, translation occurs in order to produce R.</p>

<p><b>Figure 2.</b> Regulator protein R binds to RNA Polymerase. This complex then binds to the promoter for the Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene, and this binding activates transcription. Next, translation yields YFP, which then undergoes a maturation process to produce YFP_m. </p>

<ul>
  <li>The Python file contains the program that optimized initial parameter value estimates (optimization_program.py).</li>
  <li>The Jupyter Notebook contains the resulting model as well as the parameter descriptions and values (model_and_parameters.ipynb).</li>
